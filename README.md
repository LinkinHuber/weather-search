## User story
- AS A traveler
- I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
- SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
- WHEN I search for a city
- THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
- WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- WHEN I click on a city in the search history

## What was the goal of this project?
- The goal of this project was to create a weather dashboard app that shows you today's weather plus the next 5 days for any city you input. This was achived by making mutiple api calls to https://openweathermap.org/forecast5 and then taking that info and getting it to display on the page. All your recent searches are also saved to local storage and will stay there even on page refresh plus you can click on them aswell.
